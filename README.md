# Course Management Application
Programmed, in Java, a system that uses object-oriented programming (four pillars), file IO, serialization, 
and error management to allow university and school course management

My course registration system culminates in the CourseManagementApp class, but there are a
number of classes that have been created and used that function as a basis for the system. These classes
function as abstract data types since the person writing the CourseManagementApp does not need to
understand how the methods in these other classes work, but simply needs to implement them. These
classes are User, Admin, Student, Course, and allCourses.
The Course class contains all the attributes of a course, including its name, ID, instructer, max
students, an array list of students, etc, and contains methods to interact with the individual course
including adding and deleting students, printing information, and comparing its attributes to other courses
given as parameters. This class implements the comparable interface so the compareTo() method is
overridden from that interface so that courses can be compared to each other using the number of
students in them. An array list of Course objects is created in the allCourses class. In this class, methods
are created that allow courses to interact as a whole, allowing one to input a course ID as a parameter and
then being able to interact with that course and its methods and includes methods to add or delete a
student to or from a specific course in the list, print the whole list, print only the full course, etc. The
CourseManagementApp creates an instance of the allCourses class and imports the list of courses from
the csv file of courses. These courses added to the allCourses object and it is serialized alongside a list of
Admins and Students that are currently registered in the system, and once deserialized, this allows the
current user of the app to log in by having their inputs checked against the list. The methods from
allCourses are finally used in the App to complete the required functions.

The Student and the Admin classes both have their own interfaces that define their methods and
they both inherit from the abstract User class, which contains a first and last name, a username, and a
password. The student also contains an array list of courses. The setPassword() and setUsername()
methods are overloaded in the Admin class from their use in the User class to allow the current user to
input the new username or password rather than having it as a parameter of the function. Because we
donâ€™t want a student user to be able to have the same privileges as an admin, the data fields have been
encapsulated and the student user is limited to setting their password, viewing classes, and joining or
withdrawing from them while an admin will have fewer limitations but still will not have direct access to
data types.
User Guide
1. Run the CourseManagementApp class
2. If this is your first time running the program, the information will automatically be imported
from the csv file and serialized
3. Once the data is imported, there is only one user at the start. Username: Admin, Password:
Admin001. Use these credentials to log in and use any function the admin is allowed to use
4. If you create a new student, you must exit the program to log in. When the student is created
their username is given and you may use this to login as them, create a password, and use any
functions a student is allowed to use.
5. IMPORTANT. Whenever you are finished using the program you must manually save and exit
using the options menu or your data may be lost
